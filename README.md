- [x] Project 1: Building elementary logic gates like And, Or, Not, Multiplexor, and more
    
- [x] Project 2: Building a family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
    
- [x] Project 3: Building registers and memory units, culminating in the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM)
    
- [ ] Project 4: Learning a machine language and using it to write some illustrative low-level programs
    
- [ ] Project 5: Using the chipset built in projects 1-3 to build a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in project 4
    
- [ ] Project 6: Developing an assembler, i.e. a capability to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary, executable code.
